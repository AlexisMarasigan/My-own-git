# My-own-git
This is my attempt to understand git, while also getting better at writing in python.

I will be following the [WyaG book](https://wyag.thb.lt/).
Since my system is on Windows I'll also add a Dockerfile to do the tests.
To try it yourself, once you have cloned the repo on your device, you run it with the image I will use.

Then run 

```
$ Docker build image -t . .
$ Docker run -it My-own-git bash
```
Then run 

```
$ python wyag %command
```
and choose the command you want to try
