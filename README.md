# My-own-git

This is my attempt to understand git, while also getting better at writing in python.

I will be following the [WyaG book](https://wyag.thb.lt/).
I couldn't figure out how to run it on Windows.
With a Unix sistem run

```
$ $ chmod +x wyag
```

to make wyag executable, then run

```
wyag init [path]
```
or
```
./wyag init [path]
```

to initialize your repository
