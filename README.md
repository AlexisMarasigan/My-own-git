# My-own-git
This is my attempt to understand git, while also getting better at writing in python.

I will be following the [WyaG book](https://wyag.thb.lt/).
Since my system is on Windows I'll also add a Dockerfile to do the tests.
To try it yourself, once you have cloned the repo on your device, you run it with the image I will use.
